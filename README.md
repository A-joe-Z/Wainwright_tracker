# Wainwright_tracker
Use to track what wainwrights you have climbed, who with and when.
This was developed to since me and my Dad climb wainwrights quite often and I have no of accessing which mountains I have climbed and when I did it. 

# Warning
This uses localStorage, meaning the information is stored explicitly in the browser, so it may be deleted if configured to do so
This was developed in a very short amount of time due to me having other commitments, which is why the UI is not perfect or will not work as well on mobile devices
